On the other hand, the text describes her and the gentleman as having one soul, which I take to mean he would know if she chose the tiger, in which case he'd choose the other door, yet he doesn't.

Outreach P1,261,1,0,Rebecca Perez,Hi everyone! I think what happens next is that the princess let her lover marry the woman. The reason why I think she would do that is because she loves the man (as they had made each other the center of each others universe) and she would rather see him alive then feel guilty that she is the reason why he dies (she had nightmares of her lover being killed by the tiger). The king represent determinism and barbarism by having chance dictate one's choice (which he had demonstrated in the arena.)  The princess represented free will and progressivism because she actively went out of her way to know which door held which. I do not think a good lover will put harm's way to their love ones. The princess lost the man regardless of which door she choose but at least she can fulfill her role as a lover to never put harms way in his direction and not let the barbaric nature from her father's bloodline to overcome her moral compass.,2021-02-21 16:19:02,False,13,,Elaborate

I think the moral of the story is that we can inherit bad and good traits from one's parents but when it comes to determining who we are as a character, our actions tells more than genetics (as the princess has done when she sought info for the doors rather than let her lover relied on chance at the arena).",2021-02-21 16:33:06,False,13,,Elaborate

In the story, it was implied that the princess is cunning and intelligent so I would suspect she can use her intelligence to calm down her father by appealing to his emotional side since the king is the barbaric one.

I do think that a lot of this story rests in what the reader brings to it - whether the reader thinks that the Princess would send her lover to death or give him a life without her, depends upon the reader's perception of the world and of the context of the story, rather than just the story itself.

S22 Chat Synch Data,261,1,0,Katie,"Okay, me too! Sorry there's a bit of a delay on my end.",?,True,,,Affirm
S22 Chat Synch Data,261,1,0,Rebecca,"If he knew his daughter truly loved that man but sent him to the arena because of his barbaric nature, I don't think he would extend any grace to his daughter, even though the story told us that he treasures her.",?,True,,,
S22 Chat Synch Data,261,1,0,Natalie,That's what I thought as well. I remember the description of the King being barbaric with his punishments and I think he would put his daughter in front of the doors as well,?,True,,,Affirm
S22 Chat Synch Data,261,1,0,Katie,Yep.,?,True,,,Affirm
S22 Chat Synch Data,261,1,0,Rebecca,"Do you think that the king would be tempted to do the same thing she did, though, and find out which door was which?",?,True,,,Clarify
S22 Chat Synch Data,261,1,0,Natalie,I could be wrong but I think the daughter's door opened up to being with her lover?,?,True,,,Clarify

S22 Chat Synch Data,261,1,0,Katie,"Yeah, did they actually put the King's daughter in the arena in the story?",?,True,,,Clarify
S22 Chat Synch Data,261,1,0,Rebecca,"Yeah, I think you're right. But it would be interesting if her lover ended up being behind the door she chose. Although I think the story said that it was people in the king's court that decide who goes behind the door, not the king.",?,True,,,Affirm
S22 Chat Synch Data,261,1,0,Rebecca,So I'm not sure if the king would've had a hand in putting her lover behind the door.,?,True,,,Elaborate
S22 Chat Synch Data,261,1,0,Rebecca,"But it would be interesting if the princess's actions in breaking the law made her father realize just how much she loved the man (if she did tell him of the door with the lady). So maybe he could've used his influence to put her lover behind the door, that way he could still abide by his own law but also extend love to his daughter.",?,True,,,Elaborate
S22 Chat Synch Data,261,1,0,Katie,I honestly found the writing style in the story kind of confusing?,?,True,,,

S22 Chat Synch Data,261,1,0,Alexandrea,I'm so sorry to have missed this initial conversation. I was dealing with some personal matters that prevented me from doing so. But I've caught up and I greatly enjoyed reading the discourse here.,?,True,,,
S22 Chat Synch Data,261,1,0,Alexandrea,I had similar issues reading the writing style. It took a few times to really get to the core of what was being said.,?,True,,,Affirm
S22 Chat Synch Data,261,1,0,Alexandrea,Based on the princess' description I had almost expected her to not make any motion towards the door. I assumed she would take the same 'let Fate decide' attitude as the king,?,True,,,
S22 Chat Synch Data,261,1,0,Alexandrea,"I certainly hoped that she was steering her lover away from the tiger, but can see how she would not want to see him with another woman based on the jealousy discussed above.",?,True,,,
S22 Chat Synch Data,261,1,0,Alexandrea,"Though, I do think it would have been particularly interesting to see her point him to the tiger, just for the tiger to not eat him by some stroke of luck. Perhaps the universe truly showing that the innocent go unpunished in this king's model of justice",?,True,,,
S22 Chat Synch Data,261,1,0,Alexandrea,I definitely agree with all of you stating that the king likely would subject his daughter to the same form of judgement in the arena if her actions were discovered.,?,True,,,Affirm
S22 Chat Synch Data,261,1,0,Alexandrea,"Whether or not the princess 'saved' him away from the tiger, she interferred and the kind would not allow that.",?,True,,,

S22 Chat Asynch Data,261,1,0,Stephanie,"P2: The king may send his daughter to the arena, but he will not allow her to die, so he puts a man of his choosing behind the door for her to marry. He signals to her to choose that door.",2022-03-07 20:22:13,True,8,,
S22 Chat Asynch Data,261,1,0,John,"I have no guess as to which is behind the door. Is it unclear weather or not she is even instructing him to choose the door on the right side.

S22 Chat Asynch Data,261,1,0,Christopher,"Part 1: Honestly hard to say, though I'd like to believe she spared the one she loved. That said, If she is as barbaric as her father, she could very well have sent him to his death. If she can't have him, no one can.",2022-03-11 17:49:50,True,10,,
S22 Chat Asynch Data,261,1,0,Christopher,"Part 2: The king most certainly spares his daughter, one way or another. She is his greatest pride. I say he puts on a show for the people to act as though the law is being upheld, but behind the doors are suiters of his choosing. He keeps his daughter safe and she has to marry someone he believes is the best choice for her.",2022-03-11 17:55:25,True,10,,
