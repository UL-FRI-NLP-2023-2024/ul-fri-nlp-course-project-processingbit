If you fail to categorize the sentence, return 'None' instead of coming up with a wrong class. ### NEW SENTENCE: then click on the checkmark button ### Remember to answer with only the name of the class and nothing else. You can use the following codebook (with classes, definitions and examples) to help you classify the sentence: ### IMPORTANT CODEBOOK: ### Class: UX ### ### Definition: User’s opinion about the IMapBook interface, or media they wish we would include, user experience, media, relationship with the media. ### ### Example: “I'm finding this program a bit slow and difficult to work in.” “I am not a fan of the sound effect, but would be a fan of some pictures.” ###  ### Class: Social ### ### Definition: Discussion that establishes or maintains a relationship and does NOT relate to the assignments. For example, greetings. ### ### Example: Hello! I’m excited to work with you all. ###  ### Class: Procedure ### ### Definition: Discussion toward accomplishing a task. How should the task be accomplished? Specifically, discussion of how to complete the assignment.  Big Question: How does this work? What does the teacher want us to do with this assignment? ### ### Example: Are we each supposed to submit our own interpretations or compose something together? Did we submit it? Is that why it's blank now?  What time is everyone available to meet and complete the task? ###  ### Class: Deliberation ### ### Definition: Turns related to decision-making about the content…. Or writing or wording.  For example, what should be included in a collaborative submission, how it should be worded.  The internal procedure of the group. Actionable..  This includes discussion about interpersonal functioning of the group.  Big Question: What should we do next? <Based on our current status, how do we move forward?> ### ### Example: What do you think about the questions? How should they be answered?    Nadina: In terms of just answering, I feel like the tiger was behind the door, and later the King puts his daughter to trial… Julie: That’s exactly what I think as well. ###  ### Class: Seminar ### ### Definition: Discussion on the meaning or interpretation of content. My interpretation vs. your interpretation. What does it mean? ### ### Example: Perhaps the content could mean this…  I mean I think it states that the  king does love the daughter at  some point though.   Maybe not to enough of a degree  not to put her to trial...but he  does love her, just like to a  degree she loved the man ###  ### Class: Imaginative Entry ### ### Definition: Discourse that places the learner in the discussion as an active participant ### ### Example: Does this mean that we are all like this too? ###  ### Class: Disciplinary ### ### Definition: Application of shared field to discussion of content ### ### Example: This relates to the content we reviewed at an earlier time. ###  ### Class: Other ### ### Definition: Non-sequitur or anything that doesn’t fit into any other category. ### ### Example: s60e 6f 0y 2eys 6n3y d6 n40bers ###  ### You can use the following chat history if it is relevant: ### CHAT HISTORY: Hint I _____him? then click submit I tried to read it before 7 but it's stuck on that one part ### \",\n",

I am pretty flexible and am available today-thursday just about all day. Dr. Austin said have fun with it, and it is fun to ponder what might happen in the story. I think the main reason for setting a time to discuss it at the same time would be to test the collaborative software, using the box below instead of this one. I believe we could all write in it at the same time and see each other typing and change each other\\'s words until we all agree we are done with our assessment. If we are able to do that, we might find there are unexpected positives or negatives to the collaboration process or system that we can only otherwise surmise. As you say, we\\'ve all responded to the prompts, so what we say doesn\\'t matter that much, so all we\\'d need is a few minutes to see how using the box works. So if you want to try meeting, I could do Wednesday any time of day. Just set a time and I\\'ll log on then. Thanks. I can meet tomorrow (Wednesday) at 9am EST/8CST. ### ',\n",

Her relationship with him wasn't only passionate feelings, but truly a deep love, that is why it pained the Princess so much to think of her lover with another woman.  I believe that the young man trusted the Princess, because he knew her very well.  He knew that she would defy her father and find the answer to save him.  That's why he looked to her for help.  They knew each other very well. Part 2:  I believe that the King made his daughter face her fate in the King's arena.  The King did not consider his daughter's feelings when he made her lover enter the arena.  The King didn't care whether or not his daughter would be traumatized by the event.  By sending his daughter's lover to the arena, he proved that he cared more about his own rules than the happiness and well-being of his family.  The King was more barbaric than civilized and he was very set in his ways. Hello Sandra Coleman, I think it's a good point you made that the King did not consider his daughter's feelings when he made her lover enter the arena. It does seem that when he caught them, it was immediately understood that the lover would have to put his life on the line. For that reason and his barbaric nature that is quoted a lot, I also believe he would make his daughter face her fate in the King's arena. ### \",\n",

I do think that a lot of this story rests in what the reader brings to it - whether the reader thinks that the Princess would send her lover to death or give him a life without her, depends upon the reader\\'s perception of the world and of the context of the story, rather than just the story itself. Now, I do think that the King would alter the punishment for her daughter when he finds out that she broke the law, simply because he loves her so much and I don\\'t think he would send her to the arena (although I think that would make a more interesting story in my opinion). ### Remember to answer with only the name of the class and nothing else.

Not sure he wouldn\\'t make sure what door the lion would be in and send her to the man of his choice. He is semibarbaric but loves his daughter and what better justice than marrying her with someone of his choice. Interesting ideas everyone...good job. :) Hi Rebecca Perez, I think you make an excellent point regarding the Princess representing progressivism and the Kind representing determinism. I believe that the Princess displayed qualities of progressivism from the very beginning; she choose who to love on her own accord which proves that she believes in free will and the importance of making your own decisions in life. With that being said, this is this very reason that I believe she sends her lover to the door of the tiger; she obviously believes in free will, but she still has semi-barbaric tendencies which may cause her to put her own free will above everyone else\\'s. When the King discovers that his daughter has broken the law, I believe he would most likely make an exception for her. In the story it stated that the King put the love for his  therefore I highly doubt he would send her into the arena. Because of the King views himself and his daughter as royalty, I would speculate that he would come up with an  alternate punishment for his daughter . daughter above all of humanity\" and that she was the \"apple of his eye ### ',\n",

I believe that the Princess displayed qualities of progressivism from the very beginning; she choose who to love on her own accord which proves that she believes in free will and the importance of making your own decisions in life. With that being said, this is this very reason that I believe she sends her lover to the door of the tiger; she obviously believes in free will, but she still has semi-barbaric tendencies which may cause her to put her own free will above everyone else's. ### Remember to answer with only the name of the class and nothing else.

I could see him scolding at the princess and put restrictions on her as punishment. In the story, it was implied that the princess is cunning and intelligent so I would suspect she can use her intelligence to calm down her father by appealing to his emotional side since the king is the barbaric one.  I could also see the princess twisting her father's logic that it is fate/chance that the princess has to break the law because if it  was really chance that determines all actions, then chance would had not let the princess not break the law (I hope that makes sense). *would not let the princess break the law in the first place. As for the King, I believe his system works and would put her through the same system because he fully believes in it. Not sure he wouldn't make sure what door the lion would be in and send her to the man of his choice. He is semibarbaric but loves his daughter and what better justice than marrying her with someone of his choice. Interesting ideas everyone...good job. :) ### \",\n",

I am convinced that the princess lead the gentleman to the door hiding the tiger. It would make a brilliant plot twist, but with the information we know about the character of the King, that can be found within the princess as well. In my mind she believes if she can't have the man, she sure does not want another woman to have him, especially someone she despises. As for the second part, I'm not sure if the King would carry out the same punishment for his daughter as he would the commoners. However, he would definitely think of another way to punish her that would consist of a clever, yet barbaric twist for her to prove her loyalty and worth. Hi Diane Gonzalez and Deborah Evans. I'm sorry to be so late joining the conversation. If I ponder too long, I'll never come to a conclusion, so I'm going to write my first thoughts. I share your  he's barbaric, and he's fine doling out punishment to his own daughter, as his punishment of her lover has in effect punished her as well. take that the princess will direct the gentleman to the tiger - she's lost him either way and her jealousy and barbarism are too great. On the other hand, the text describes her and the gentleman as having one soul, which I take to mean he would know if she chose the tiger, in which case he'd choose the other door, yet he doesn't. So does that mean she didn't choose the tiger? Or that he'd rather die than be with another woman? For Part 2, I believe the king likely would not show mercy, even to his own daughter, as he has consistently relied on this method of justice ### \",\n",

I believe that the Princess displayed qualities of progressivism from the very beginning; she choose who to love on her own accord which proves that she believes in free will and the importance of making your own decisions in life. With that being said, this is this very reason that I believe she sends her lover to the door of the tiger; she obviously believes in free will, but she still has semi-barbaric tendencies which may cause her to put her own free will above everyone else\\'s. When the King discovers that his daughter has broken the law, I believe he would most likely make an exception for her. In the story it stated that the King put the love for his  therefore I highly doubt he would send her into the arena. Because of the King views himself and his daughter as royalty, I would speculate that he would come up with an  alternate punishment for his daughter . daughter above all of humanity\" and that she was the \"apple of his eye My first thought was that the Princess would send her lover to the tiger (because she is like her father and seems to spend a lot more time dwelling on what would happen if he chose the door with the lady than what would happen if he got the tiger), but Michelle makes a good point - that she represents free will in opposition to her father (by finding out what was behind each door). I do think that a lot of this story rests in what the reader brings to it - whether the reader thinks that the Princess would send her lover to death or give him a life without her, depends upon the reader\\'s perception of the world and of the context of the story, rather than just the story itself. Now, I do think that the King would alter the punishment for her daughter when he finds out that she broke the law, simply because he loves her so much and I don\\'t think he would send her to the arena (although I think that would make a more interesting story in my opinion). ### ',\n",

The King was more barbaric than civilized and he was very set in his ways. ### Remember to answer with only the name of the class and nothing else.

Based on how the Princess is described as barbaric\" like her father  I think the King sends his daughter into the tribunal as well. He seems set in his ways and seems to value power over logic.\" and how she struggles between the two options of leading him to his death or leading him to a life. Part two: as mentioned earlier Hi Kathryn Bell! I am curious to know why you think the lover would not follow the princess\\'s instructions to open the door on the right? While the princess definitely felt untrustworthy to me, I did not get a sense that the lover felt that from her. Part 1:  I believe that the Princess indicated for her lover to choose the door with the other lady behind it, because her love for him was strong.  Her relationship with him wasn\\'t only passionate feelings, but truly a deep love, that is why it pained the Princess so much to think of her lover with another woman.  I believe that the young man trusted the Princess, because he knew her very well.  He knew that she would defy her father and find the answer to save him.  That\\'s why he looked to her for help.  They knew each other very well. ### ',\n",

Given the princess's stealth and cunning in find out what was behind each door, I think she would rather see her lover dead than alive. I agree with you Lillian Flores about it depending on someone, but I feel that it is up to the person reading the story and reflecting on the actions of the characters. In this case, the princess was jealous of the girl and she was also semi-barbaric like her father, so I feel she would have chosen the door with the tiger for the man. If I go with my own emotions, even though the author said not to base it on that, I would think that the princess would make the right choice with the right door and let him marry the man.  Although, would the man trust the princess enough and choose the same door as she indicated? So behind the right door would be the tiger.  They are both semibarbaric, so the King would most likely be disappointed at first, but either way, he got what he wanted and that was to keep his daughter away from this man. In this case, either sentence would be justice in his eyes. Marry the girl not the man. ### \",\n",

I enjoyed reading all of your perspectives.  Nicole Gonzalez- I also found the idea of barbarism\" kind of unsettling... I guess it was a pretty common theme in story telling in the \"old  but reading from my 21st century perspective days\"  it feels like labeling the society as \"other\" or \"bad\".\" Hi Helen Howard! I feel this text is meant to unsettle in a way. It wasn\\'t just the barbarism but also the mention of ancestry and blood that made me think it was fatalistic in a way. Kind of like the King and Princess were destined to act in cruel ways. I\\'m glad that someone else picked up on it too and I really liked your point that it does feel labeling a society in sweeping terms. ### ',\n",

Part 2: With how the King wants to assert his power over his kingdom and people, I believe he would make an example out of his daughter and send her to same fate as her lover. He didn't take her feelings about her lover into consideration so that shows how brutal his mind and rule is. Part 1: I think the princess hints to him the door with the lover.

In this case, the princess was jealous of the girl and she was also semi-barbaric like her father, so I feel she would have chosen the door with the tiger for the man. If I go with my own emotions, even though the author said not to base it on that, I would think that the princess would make the right choice with the right door and let him marry the man.  Although, would the man trust the princess enough and choose the same door as she indicated? So behind the right door would be the tiger.  They are both semibarbaric, so the King would most likely be disappointed at first, but either way, he got what he wanted and that was to keep his daughter away from this man. In this case, either sentence would be justice in his eyes. Marry the girl not the man. Hi Anne Lee. Yes, the reader will certainly bring her or his background and ideas to the story.

The story tells us that she is the apple of his eye  and that she is above all what his heart cares for.  I do not think he could bear losing her or watching her give love to anyone but him.  I fear the father would punish her by keeping her with him for the rest of her life.  Going to the arena would be too much punishment for him. ### \",\n",

You can use the following codebook (with classes, definitions and examples) to help you classify the sentence: ### IMPORTANT CODEBOOK: ### Class: UX ### ### Definition: User’s opinion about the IMapBook interface, or media they wish we would include, user experience, media, relationship with the media. ### ### Example: “I'm finding this program a bit slow and difficult to work in.” “I am not a fan of the sound effect, but would be a fan of some pictures.” ###  ### Class: Social ### ### Definition: Discussion that establishes or maintains a relationship and does NOT relate to the assignments. For example, greetings. ### ### Example: Hello! I’m excited to work with you all. ###  ### Class: Procedure ### ### Definition: Discussion toward accomplishing a task. How should the task be accomplished? Specifically, discussion of how to complete the assignment.  Big Question: How does this work? What does the teacher want us to do with this assignment? ### ### Example: Are we each supposed to submit our own interpretations or compose something together? Did we submit it? Is that why it's blank now?  What time is everyone available to meet and complete the task? ###  ### Class: Deliberation ### ### Definition: Turns related to decision-making about the content…. Or writing or wording.  For example, what should be included in a collaborative submission, how it should be worded.  The internal procedure of the group. Actionable..  This includes discussion about interpersonal functioning of the group.  Big Question: What should we do next? <Based on our current status, how do we move forward?> ### ### Example: What do you think about the questions? How should they be answered?    Nadina: In terms of just answering, I feel like the tiger was behind the door, and later the King puts his daughter to trial… Julie: That’s exactly what I think as well. ###  ### Class: Seminar ### ### Definition: Discussion on the meaning or interpretation of content. My interpretation vs. your interpretation. What does it mean? ### ### Example: Perhaps the content could mean this…  I mean I think it states that the  king does love the daughter at  some point though.   Maybe not to enough of a degree  not to put her to trial...but he  does love her, just like to a  degree she loved the man ###  ### Class: Imaginative Entry ### ### Definition: Discourse that places the learner in the discussion as an active participant ### ### Example: Does this mean that we are all like this too? ###  ### Class: Disciplinary ### ### Definition: Application of shared field to discussion of content ### ### Example: This relates to the content we reviewed at an earlier time. ###  ### Class: Other ### ### Definition: Non-sequitur or anything that doesn’t fit into any other category. ### ### Example: s60e 6f 0y 2eys 6n3y d6 n40bers ###  ### You can use the following chat history if it is relevant: ### CHAT HISTORY: emission meaning what? im confused on what sam is trying to say we all aee ### \",\n",

If she had faith in him truly, she would let him live with the lady. At least he would be alive and happy. But if she was full of distrust or jealousy she would kill her lover. Even if she is semi-barbaric she seems to be fair or at least a follower of her Father. I would say she would point to the Lady in the end. Interesting Jennifer Gonzalez that I initially thought the Tiger because of her jealousy and that if she could not have him, then no one could have him. But, I changed my mind with the hope of a happier ending. I believe the lady was behind the door as the description of the princess was \"semi-barbaric.\" She could probably have the new couple banished from the kingdom so she would not have to see them. I believe it was the tiger because the princess could not bear for anyone else to have him. ### ',\n",

I think what happens next is that the princess let her lover marry the woman. The reason why I think she would do that is because she loves the man (as they had made each other the center of each others universe) and she would rather see him alive then feel guilty that she is the reason why he dies (she had nightmares of her lover being killed by the tiger). The king represent determinism and barbarism by having chance dictate one's choice (which he had demonstrated in the arena.)  The princess represented free will and progressivism because she actively went out of her way to know which door held which. I do not think a good lover will put harm's way to their love ones. The princess lost the man regardless of which door she choose but at least she can fulfill her role as a lover to never put harms way in his direction and not let the barbaric nature from her father's bloodline to overcome her moral compass. Yes, I understand the princess hated the to-be-bride but I just can't see the princess letting her lover die when she went to find out which door led to what. Don't you guys think that symbolize the progressive nature of the princess compared to the king's barbarism where the king rather let chance decide than free will? I think the moral of the story is that we can inherit bad and good traits from one's parents but when it comes to determining who we are as a character, our actions tells more than genetics (as the princess has done when she sought info for the doors rather than let her lover relied on chance at the arena). As for the 2nd part of the discussion, I don't think the king will ever hurt his daughter as it was mentioned in the story that she is the apple of his eye. I could see him scolding at the princess and put restrictions on her as punishment. In the story, it was implied that the princess is cunning and intelligent so I would suspect she can use her intelligence to calm down her father by appealing to his emotional side since the king is the barbaric one.  I could also see the princess twisting her father's logic that it is fate/chance that the princess has to break the law because if it  was really chance that determines all actions, then chance would had not let the princess not break the law (I hope that makes sense). ### \",\n",

Also, the end of the story says that she knew he would ask her, just as he knew she would take it upon herself to find out, so I think that she would not be able to lead him to the door with the tiger and live with that, especially if she thought about what she would tell him days before.

To me, it is more likely that the princess would tell the man to open the door to the tiger. There was no mention of the princess questioning the morality of sending him to his death. In fact, it appeared like she was leaning towards it as the more merciful option because he would have a quick death and then be waiting for her in the afterlife. I think if she was going to send him to the other lady, she would have shown more guilt over the option of the tiger. As for the second question, I imagine the king would definitely send the princess to her own trial just like her lover. His barbarism is so calculated. He has come up with his perfect judgement system, allowing the accused to choose their own fate and leave it up to chance. I don't think there would be any exception to his system, even his own daughter. Hi everyone! I think what happens next is that the princess let her lover marry the woman. The reason why I think she would do that is because she loves the man (as they had made each other the center of each others universe) and she would rather see him alive then feel guilty that she is the reason why he dies (she had nightmares of her lover being killed by the tiger). The king represent determinism and barbarism by having chance dictate one's choice (which he had demonstrated in the arena.)  The princess represented free will and progressivism because she actively went out of her way to know which door held which. I do not think a good lover will put harm's way to their love ones. The princess lost the man regardless of which door she choose but at least she can fulfill her role as a lover to never put harms way in his direction and not let the barbaric nature from her father's bloodline to overcome her moral compass. ### \",\n",

She is his greatest pride. I say he puts on a show for the people to act as though the law is being upheld, but behind the doors are suiters of his choosing. He keeps his daughter safe and she has to marry someone he believes is the best choice for her. ### Remember to answer with only the name of the class and nothing else.

Is it unclear weather or not she is even instructing him to choose the door on the right side. She could have raised her right hand to signal “DON’T go in that door, the tiger is there.” Part 2: The daughter is “the apple of the king’s eye”, therefore, I believe he will not disclose this knowledge to anyone. This would save her from a trial. Part 1: Honestly hard to say, though I'd like to believe she spared the one she loved. That said, If she is as barbaric as her father, she could very well have sent him to his death. If she can't have him, no one can. ### \",\n",

You can use the following codebook (with classes, definitions and examples) to help you classify the sentence: ### IMPORTANT CODEBOOK: ### Class: UX ### ### Definition: User’s opinion about the IMapBook interface, or media they wish we would include, user experience, media, relationship with the media. ### ### Example: “I'm finding this program a bit slow and difficult to work in.” “I am not a fan of the sound effect, but would be a fan of some pictures.” ###  ### Class: Social ### ### Definition: Discussion that establishes or maintains a relationship and does NOT relate to the assignments. For example, greetings. ### ### Example: Hello! I’m excited to work with you all. ###  ### Class: Procedure ### ### Definition: Discussion toward accomplishing a task. How should the task be accomplished? Specifically, discussion of how to complete the assignment.  Big Question: How does this work? What does the teacher want us to do with this assignment? ### ### Example: Are we each supposed to submit our own interpretations or compose something together? Did we submit it? Is that why it's blank now?  What time is everyone available to meet and complete the task? ###  ### Class: Deliberation ### ### Definition: Turns related to decision-making about the content…. Or writing or wording.  For example, what should be included in a collaborative submission, how it should be worded.  The internal procedure of the group. Actionable..  This includes discussion about interpersonal functioning of the group.  Big Question: What should we do next? <Based on our current status, how do we move forward?> ### ### Example: What do you think about the questions? How should they be answered?    Nadina: In terms of just answering, I feel like the tiger was behind the door, and later the King puts his daughter to trial… Julie: That’s exactly what I think as well. ###  ### Class: Seminar ### ### Definition: Discussion on the meaning or interpretation of content. My interpretation vs. your interpretation. What does it mean? ### ### Example: Perhaps the content could mean this…  I mean I think it states that the  king does love the daughter at  some point though.   Maybe not to enough of a degree  not to put her to trial...but he  does love her, just like to a  degree she loved the man ###  ### Class: Imaginative Entry ### ### Definition: Discourse that places the learner in the discussion as an active participant ### ### Example: Does this mean that we are all like this too? ###  ### Class: Disciplinary ### ### Definition: Application of shared field to discussion of content ### ### Example: This relates to the content we reviewed at an earlier time. ###  ### Class: Other ### ### Definition: Non-sequitur or anything that doesn’t fit into any other category. ### ### Example: s60e 6f 0y 2eys 6n3y d6 n40bers ###  ### You can use the following chat history if it is relevant: ### CHAT HISTORY: Where did you see those descriptions, Natalie? Yeah, did they actually put the King's daughter in the arena in the story? Yeah, I think you're right. But it would be interesting if her lover ended up being behind the door she chose. Although I think the story said that it was people in the king's court that decide who goes behind the door, not the king. ### \",\n",

The story tells us that she is the apple of his eye  and that she is above all what his heart cares for.  I do not think he could bear losing her or watching her give love to anyone but him.  I fear the father would punish her by keeping her with him for the rest of her life.

To me, it is more likely that the princess would tell the man to open the door to the tiger. There was no mention of the princess questioning the morality of sending him to his death. In fact, it appeared like she was leaning towards it as the more merciful option because he would have a quick death and then be waiting for her in the afterlife.

The story also noted that she had seen her lover talk to the lady before, and assumed that her jealousy would be known to him prior to his tribunal. I feel that with the personalities traits provided to both the king and princess, she decided that death would be more appropriate than another woman, a rival, living happily with her lover. The princess was already wavering with deciding if he was faithful, so why would she give him and her rival the satisfaction? The lion seems to be the only choice for her disposition and upbringing. Part 2: With the events led, created, and executed by the king, one would believe he would send his daughter to the arena as she has committed a crime, embarrassed the king, and went against the rules. He is semi-barbaric so he will probably feel guilt as the story states he loves his daughter, but he is also king. He wants to keep in power and with these events, shows his power to rule over life and death. His character would choose fame, power, and glory over love as with these events, sympathy is not a strong theme in this story. ### \",\n",

Although the King is one that like to follows the rules and has a very barbaric side, he doesn\\'t send his daughter to the tribunal. Instead he makes her live with the agony of living without her love and while facing the fact of her character. Part One: The princess seemed more threatened and bothered by the image of her lover going into the arms of another, than by the image of a tiger tearing him apart. I don\\'t remember her exact words, but she thinks him dying quickly if the tiger is behind the door is a better fate for him. I\\'m not a fan of the barbaric ancestry and tendencies this text brings up, but it seems to be given as the reason for the King and Princess to act cruel and savagely. Therefore, I do think that that behind the door the Princess motioned to is the tiger. The story reads to me as if the Princess would rather have her lover to herself in perpetuity (in her mind) by killing him off now instead of see him with someone else. ### ',\n",

Mourning would be easier than seeing the person you love happy with another, which is clear by the ways she describes her thoughts and turmoil over the situation. I believe the King would be upset that the rules of his arena were broken. But But I think he would also revel in the fact that his daughter could be so barbaric.

I feel this text is meant to unsettle in a way. It wasn\\'t just the barbarism but also the mention of ancestry and blood that made me think it was fatalistic in a way. Kind of like the King and Princess were destined to act in cruel ways. I\\'m glad that someone else picked up on it too and I really liked your point that it does feel labeling a society in sweeping terms. Part one: I think the lover follows the Princess\\'s instructions and opens the door on the right to the tiger. Based on how the Princess is described as barbaric\" like her father  I think the King sends his daughter into the tribunal as well. He seems set in his ways and seems to value power over logic.\" and how she struggles between the two options of leading him to his death or leading him to a life. Part two: as mentioned earlier Hi Kathryn Bell! I am curious to know why you think the lover would not follow the princess\\'s instructions to open the door on the right? While the princess definitely felt untrustworthy to me, I did not get a sense that the lover felt that from her. ### ',\n",

This isn\\'t a question of whether or not she loves him, or even trusts him. It\\'s clearly written that she loves him dearly, and his trustworthiness isn\\'t something to consider so heavily since she will lose him heavily. I think she points him to the tiger because of how much more thought she put into the aftermath of sending him towards the lady. She laments on how horrifying it would be to watch her loved one die at the hands of ferocity, but laments even more at the thought of watching him live a different life with someone other than her. She even gives his death a hopeful spin, that they may meet again in the afterlife or some equivalent, but gives no optimistic spin to him choosing the lady, she even mentions the whole if she can\\'t have him no one can.\"\" since she will lose him anyway* I agree with you ladies. I also think that she sends him to the tiger. She loves him fiercely, so fiercely that she cannot bear the thought of someone else having him. Jealousy can make people do ugly things and mix that in with her pure barbaric nature, it makes sense that she would choose for him to stop living versus living with someone else. Mourning would be easier than seeing the person you love happy with another, which is clear by the ways she describes her thoughts and turmoil over the situation. ### ',\n",

In this case, the princess was jealous of the girl and she was also semi-barbaric like her father, so I feel she would have chosen the door with the tiger for the man. If I go with my own emotions, even though the author said not to base it on that, I would think that the princess would make the right choice with the right door and let him marry the man.  Although, would the man trust the princess enough and choose the same door as she indicated? So behind the right door would be the tiger.  They are both semibarbaric, so the King would most likely be disappointed at first, but either way, he got what he wanted and that was to keep his daughter away from this man. In this case, either sentence would be justice in his eyes. ### Remember to answer with only the name of the class and nothing else.

He is semibarbaric but loves his daughter and what better justice than marrying her with someone of his choice. Interesting ideas everyone...good job. :) Hi Rebecca Perez, I think you make an excellent point regarding the Princess representing progressivism and the Kind representing determinism. I believe that the Princess displayed qualities of progressivism from the very beginning; she choose who to love on her own accord which proves that she believes in free will and the importance of making your own decisions in life. With that being said, this is this very reason that I believe she sends her lover to the door of the tiger; she obviously believes in free will, but she still has semi-barbaric tendencies which may cause her to put her own free will above everyone else\\'s. ### ',\n",

Therefore, I do think that that behind the door the Princess motioned to is the tiger. The story reads to me as if the Princess would rather have her lover to herself in perpetuity (in her mind) by killing him off now instead of see him with someone else. ### Remember to answer with only the name of the class and nothing else.

He would not make an exception for her because he feels that he needs to establish his power over the citizens of the kingdom.  If he subjects his daughter to the same punishment, then he is proving his stance and making an example of her to his kingdom.  I believe she would find a way to outwit the King, maybe with the help of her lover who she granted life to in part one. I think she tells him to go to the right but he goes to the left, finding the lady behind the door. In that moment realizes that she led him to his death. The Princess then has to face the fact that he found out she would rather see him dead than with the lady. Although the King is one that like to follows the rules and has a very barbaric side, he doesn't send his daughter to the tribunal. Instead he makes her live with the agony of living without her love and while facing the fact of her character. ### \",\n",

I am curious to know why you think the lover would not follow the princess's instructions to open the door on the right? While the princess definitely felt untrustworthy to me, I did not get a sense that the lover felt that from her. Part 1:  I believe that the Princess indicated for her lover to choose the door with the other lady behind it, because her love for him was strong.  Her relationship with him wasn't only passionate feelings, but truly a deep love, that is why it pained the Princess so much to think of her lover with another woman.  I believe that the young man trusted the Princess, because he knew her very well.  He knew that she would defy her father and find the answer to save him.  That's why he looked to her for help.  They knew each other very well. Part 2:  I believe that the King made his daughter face her fate in the King's arena.  The King did not consider his daughter's feelings when he made her lover enter the arena.  The King didn't care whether or not his daughter would be traumatized by the event.  By sending his daughter's lover to the arena, he proved that he cared more about his own rules than the happiness and well-being of his family.  The King was more barbaric than civilized and he was very set in his ways. ### \",\n",

I could see him scolding at the princess and put restrictions on her as punishment. In the story, it was implied that the princess is cunning and intelligent so I would suspect she can use her intelligence to calm down her father by appealing to his emotional side since the king is the barbaric one.  I could also see the princess twisting her father's logic that it is fate/chance that the princess has to break the law because if it  was really chance that determines all actions, then chance would had not let the princess not break the law (I hope that makes sense). ### Remember to answer with only the name of the class and nothing else.

His barbarism is so calculated. He has come up with his perfect judgement system, allowing the accused to choose their own fate and leave it up to chance. I don't think there would be any exception to his system, even his own daughter. Hi everyone! I think what happens next is that the princess let her lover marry the woman. The reason why I think she would do that is because she loves the man (as they had made each other the center of each others universe) and she would rather see him alive then feel guilty that she is the reason why he dies (she had nightmares of her lover being killed by the tiger). The king represent determinism and barbarism by having chance dictate one's choice (which he had demonstrated in the arena.)  The princess represented free will and progressivism because she actively went out of her way to know which door held which. I do not think a good lover will put harm's way to their love ones. The princess lost the man regardless of which door she choose but at least she can fulfill her role as a lover to never put harms way in his direction and not let the barbaric nature from her father's bloodline to overcome her moral compass. Yes, I understand the princess hated the to-be-bride but I just can't see the princess letting her lover die when she went to find out which door led to what. Don't you guys think that symbolize the progressive nature of the princess compared to the king's barbarism where the king rather let chance decide than free will? I think the moral of the story is that we can inherit bad and good traits from one's parents but when it comes to determining who we are as a character, our actions tells more than genetics (as the princess has done when she sought info for the doors rather than let her lover relied on chance at the arena). ### \",\n",

Instead he makes her live with the agony of living without her love and while facing the fact of her character. Part One: The princess seemed more threatened and bothered by the image of her lover going into the arms of another, than by the image of a tiger tearing him apart. I don\\'t remember her exact words, but she thinks him dying quickly if the tiger is behind the door is a better fate for him. I\\'m not a fan of the barbaric ancestry and tendencies this text brings up, but it seems to be given as the reason for the King and Princess to act cruel and savagely. Therefore, I do think that that behind the door the Princess motioned to is the tiger. The story reads to me as if the Princess would rather have her lover to herself in perpetuity (in her mind) by killing him off now instead of see him with someone else. Part One con\\'t: Oops, sent the rest before finishing this thought. I think the lover goes to the door on the left instead of the door on the right, thinking on her barbaric\" nature and that she\\'d likely betray him  and finds a lady instead of the tiger. I\\'m assuming even though he knows her  it would leave him in shock knowing that the Princess would want him dead if she cannot keep him to herself.\" ### ',\n",

The princess was already wavering with deciding if he was faithful, so why would she give him and her rival the satisfaction? The lion seems to be the only choice for her disposition and upbringing. Part 2: With the events led, created, and executed by the king, one would believe he would send his daughter to the arena as she has committed a crime, embarrassed the king, and went against the rules. He is semi-barbaric so he will probably feel guilt as the story states he loves his daughter, but he is also king. He wants to keep in power and with these events, shows his power to rule over life and death. His character would choose fame, power, and glory over love as with these events, sympathy is not a strong theme in this story. Hi Douglas Jackson, I like your point in Part 1 about semi barbarous but I feel she showed her mercy in dwelling on the issues day and night, losing sleep, and imagining both scenarios. The readers feels the guilt she portrays, but in the end I believe with her being the daughter of the king who created this judicial system, and growing up around these barbarous events, she sent him into the lions den - literally! ### \",\n",

He is semi-barbaric so he will probably feel guilt as the story states he loves his daughter, but he is also king. He wants to keep in power and with these events, shows his power to rule over life and death. His character would choose fame, power, and glory over love as with these events, sympathy is not a strong theme in this story. Hi Douglas Jackson, I like your point in Part 1 about semi barbarous but I feel she showed her mercy in dwelling on the issues day and night, losing sleep, and imagining both scenarios. The readers feels the guilt she portrays, but in the end I believe with her being the daughter of the king who created this judicial system, and growing up around these barbarous events, she sent him into the lions den - literally! I have never heard this story before... and I was wondering if it is some kind of folk tale?  Has anyone else seen this story before and do you know what culture it is from? ### \",\n",

I actually had the same question as I had never heard this story before. So I did some research! This short story was written by Frank Stockton in 1882.

Thanks for the info and research, I was wondering about this story as well. I've never read it before. In part one I think he chose the princess because of her hints.  In part two she broke the rules so the king must be true to his role as leader and must trust fate and deal with his daughter how he would anyone else. ### \",\n",

The King did not consider his daughter's feelings when he made her lover enter the arena.  The King didn't care whether or not his daughter would be traumatized by the event.  By sending his daughter's lover to the arena, he proved that he cared more about his own rules than the happiness and well-being of his family.  The King was more barbaric than civilized and he was very set in his ways. Hello Sandra Coleman, I think it's a good point you made that the King did not consider his daughter's feelings when he made her lover enter the arena. It does seem that when he caught them, it was immediately understood that the lover would have to put his life on the line. For that reason and his barbaric nature that is quoted a lot, I also believe he would make his daughter face her fate in the King's arena. Part 1: I believe that he chooses the door that the Princess gives him the hint to choose. When he opens the door, the lady is there because the Princess has love that very strong for him. She knows that she would rather know that he is alive and happy than send him to his end. ### \",\n",

It\\'s clearly written that she loves him dearly, and his trustworthiness isn\\'t something to consider so heavily since she will lose him heavily.

Also, the end of the story says that she knew he would ask her, just as he knew she would take it upon herself to find out, so I think that she would not be able to lead him to the door with the tiger and live with that, especially if she thought about what she would tell him days before.

The Princess grappled with her thoughts and instincts, feeling jealous and thinking about sending her lover to his death rather than see him with another woman.  She ended up indicating the door which held the beautiful woman because she realized that she couldn't live with the knowledge that she had sent her lover to his ruin.  Deciding that she would rather see him alive, she shows him which door to pick. Part Two:  I believe the King would send his daughter to the tribunal, because even though he loves her and she is the apple of his eye, he is illustrated to be set in his ways.  He would not make an exception for her because he feels that he needs to establish his power over the citizens of the kingdom.  If he subjects his daughter to the same punishment, then he is proving his stance and making an example of her to his kingdom.  I believe she would find a way to outwit the King, maybe with the help of her lover who she granted life to in part one. ### \",\n",

I can log back in later to see if anyone else is ready.  Should we try to figure out a time to all come back and work in here together? ### Remember to answer with only the name of the class and nothing else. You can use the following codebook (with classes, definitions and examples) to help you classify the sentence: ### IMPORTANT CODEBOOK: ### Class: UX ### ### Definition: User’s opinion about the IMapBook interface, or media they wish we would include, user experience, media, relationship with the media. ### ### Example: “I'm finding this program a bit slow and difficult to work in.” “I am not a fan of the sound effect, but would be a fan of some pictures.” ###  ### Class: Social ### ### Definition: Discussion that establishes or maintains a relationship and does NOT relate to the assignments. For example, greetings. ### ### Example: Hello! I’m excited to work with you all. ###  ### Class: Procedure ### ### Definition: Discussion toward accomplishing a task. How should the task be accomplished? Specifically, discussion of how to complete the assignment.  Big Question: How does this work? What does the teacher want us to do with this assignment? ### ### Example: Are we each supposed to submit our own interpretations or compose something together? Did we submit it? Is that why it's blank now?  What time is everyone available to meet and complete the task? ###  ### Class: Deliberation ### ### Definition: Turns related to decision-making about the content…. Or writing or wording.  For example, what should be included in a collaborative submission, how it should be worded.  The internal procedure of the group. Actionable..  This includes discussion about interpersonal functioning of the group.  Big Question: What should we do next? <Based on our current status, how do we move forward?> ### ### Example: What do you think about the questions? How should they be answered?    Nadina: In terms of just answering, I feel like the tiger was behind the door, and later the King puts his daughter to trial… Julie: That’s exactly what I think as well. ###  ### Class: Seminar ### ### Definition: Discussion on the meaning or interpretation of content. My interpretation vs. your interpretation. What does it mean? ### ### Example: Perhaps the content could mean this…  I mean I think it states that the  king does love the daughter at  some point though.   Maybe not to enough of a degree  not to put her to trial...but he  does love her, just like to a  degree she loved the man ###  ### Class: Imaginative Entry ### ### Definition: Discourse that places the learner in the discussion as an active participant ### ### Example: Does this mean that we are all like this too? ###  ### Class: Disciplinary ### ### Definition: Application of shared field to discussion of content ### ### Example: This relates to the content we reviewed at an earlier time. ###  ### Class: Other ### ### Definition: Non-sequitur or anything that doesn’t fit into any other category. ### ### Example: s60e 6f 0y 2eys 6n3y d6 n40bers ###  ### You can use the following chat history if it is relevant: ### CHAT HISTORY: <NA> ### \",\n",

If you fail to categorize the sentence, return 'None' instead of coming up with a wrong class. ### NEW SENTENCE: Part 2: With the events led, created, and executed by the king, one would believe he would send his daughter to the arena as she has committed a crime, embarrassed the king, and went against the rules. He is semi-barbaric so he will probably feel guilt as the story states he loves his daughter, but he is also king. He wants to keep in power and with these events, shows his power to rule over life and death. His character would choose fame, power, and glory over love as with these events, sympathy is not a strong theme in this story. ### Remember to answer with only the name of the class and nothing else.

She has broken the rules like anyone else and so as someone who has put their trust in fate he would subject his daughter to the same punishment. Ultimately I think he would believe that she would prevail in hist justice system. Hi Teresa Stewart, I felt that if he truly knew her, he would know her true character and her barbaric side. The story also noted that she had seen her lover talk to the lady before, and assumed that her jealousy would be known to him prior to his tribunal. I feel that with the personalities traits provided to both the king and princess, she decided that death would be more appropriate than another woman, a rival, living happily with her lover. The princess was already wavering with deciding if he was faithful, so why would she give him and her rival the satisfaction? The lion seems to be the only choice for her disposition and upbringing. ### \",\n",

I'm sorry to be so late joining the conversation. If I ponder too long, I'll never come to a conclusion, so I'm going to write my first thoughts. I share your  he's barbaric, and he's fine doling out punishment to his own daughter, as his punishment of her lover has in effect punished her as well. take that the princess will direct the gentleman to the tiger - she's lost him either way and her jealousy and barbarism are too great. On the other hand, the text describes her and the gentleman as having one soul, which I take to mean he would know if she chose the tiger, in which case he'd choose the other door, yet he doesn't. So does that mean she didn't choose the tiger? Or that he'd rather die than be with another woman? For Part 2, I believe the king likely would not show mercy, even to his own daughter, as he has consistently relied on this method of justice We can continue to discuss individually, or if you want to try writing collaboratively at the same time, please suggest a time. I'm available any evening this week starting at 6 p.m. I'll keep tabs on here from now on to see if you want to do that. Thanks, Robyn Curiosity got the best of me, and I googled this book, which I'd never heard of despite it being a well-known allegory. It presents an unsolvable problem, yet we all felt pretty confident taking a stab at answering the prompts. I wonder what we are to make of all of us feeling pretty certain the princess chose the tiger. Is our choice based on the author's characterization of her or our belief that human nature is fundamentally selfish? ### \",\n",

He signals to her to choose that door. I have no guess as to which is behind the door. Is it unclear weather or not she is even instructing him to choose the door on the right side. She could have raised her right hand to signal “DON’T go in that door, the tiger is there.” Part 2: The daughter is “the apple of the king’s eye”, therefore, I believe he will not disclose this knowledge to anyone.

Don't you guys think that symbolize the progressive nature of the princess compared to the king's barbarism where the king rather let chance decide than free will? I think the moral of the story is that we can inherit bad and good traits from one's parents but when it comes to determining who we are as a character, our actions tells more than genetics (as the princess has done when she sought info for the doors rather than let her lover relied on chance at the arena). As for the 2nd part of the discussion, I don't think the king will ever hurt his daughter as it was mentioned in the story that she is the apple of his eye. I could see him scolding at the princess and put restrictions on her as punishment. In the story, it was implied that the princess is cunning and intelligent so I would suspect she can use her intelligence to calm down her father by appealing to his emotional side since the king is the barbaric one.  I could also see the princess twisting her father's logic that it is fate/chance that the princess has to break the law because if it  was really chance that determines all actions, then chance would had not let the princess not break the law (I hope that makes sense). *would not let the princess break the law in the first place. ### \",\n",

The Princess grappled with her thoughts and instincts, feeling jealous and thinking about sending her lover to his death rather than see him with another woman.  She ended up indicating the door which held the beautiful woman because she realized that she couldn't live with the knowledge that she had sent her lover to his ruin.  Deciding that she would rather see him alive, she shows him which door to pick. Part Two:  I believe the King would send his daughter to the tribunal, because even though he loves her and she is the apple of his eye, he is illustrated to be set in his ways.  He would not make an exception for her because he feels that he needs to establish his power over the citizens of the kingdom.  If he subjects his daughter to the same punishment, then he is proving his stance and making an example of her to his kingdom.  I believe she would find a way to outwit the King, maybe with the help of her lover who she granted life to in part one. I think she tells him to go to the right but he goes to the left, finding the lady behind the door. In that moment realizes that she led him to his death. The Princess then has to face the fact that he found out she would rather see him dead than with the lady. ### \",\n",

I also agree that while the king may feel a bit of pride for his daughter, he holds his beliefs in his chance of fate style of justice so closely to his chest, so he most likely made an example out of his daughter as well.

It does seem that when he caught them, it was immediately understood that the lover would have to put his life on the line. For that reason and his barbaric nature that is quoted a lot, I also believe he would make his daughter face her fate in the King's arena. Part 1: I believe that he chooses the door that the Princess gives him the hint to choose. When he opens the door, the lady is there because the Princess has love that very strong for him. She knows that she would rather know that he is alive and happy than send him to his end. Part 2: With how the King wants to assert his power over his kingdom and people, I believe he would make an example out of his daughter and send her to same fate as her lover. He didn't take her feelings about her lover into consideration so that shows how brutal his mind and rule is. ### \",\n",

However, he would definitely think of another way to punish her that would consist of a clever, yet barbaric twist for her to prove her loyalty and worth. Hi Diane Gonzalez and Deborah Evans. I'm sorry to be so late joining the conversation. If I ponder too long, I'll never come to a conclusion, so I'm going to write my first thoughts. I share your  he's barbaric, and he's fine doling out punishment to his own daughter, as his punishment of her lover has in effect punished her as well. take that the princess will direct the gentleman to the tiger - she's lost him either way and her jealousy and barbarism are too great. On the other hand, the text describes her and the gentleman as having one soul, which I take to mean he would know if she chose the tiger, in which case he'd choose the other door, yet he doesn't. So does that mean she didn't choose the tiger? Or that he'd rather die than be with another woman? For Part 2, I believe the king likely would not show mercy, even to his own daughter, as he has consistently relied on this method of justice We can continue to discuss individually, or if you want to try writing collaboratively at the same time, please suggest a time. I'm available any evening this week starting at 6 p.m. I'll keep tabs on here from now on to see if you want to do that. Thanks, Robyn ### \",\n",

I wonder what we are to make of all of us feeling pretty certain the princess chose the tiger. Is our choice based on the author's characterization of her or our belief that human nature is fundamentally selfish? I don't think I should have gone outside this platform to Google the book since this is supposed to be a discussion between us via this platform. Sorry about that. Cheryl Diaz, you bring up a good point - are we truly using the information gained through the reading or our own beliefs that human nature is fundamentally selfish.

       " \"You are an AI expert in categorizing sentences. You need to categorize the new sentence into one of the following classes: [UX, Social, Procedure, Deliberation, Seminar, Imaginative Entry, Disciplinary, Other]. If you fail to categorize the sentence, return 'None' instead of coming up with a wrong class. ### NEW SENTENCE: P1: I believe the tiger is behind the door. ### Remember to answer with only the name of the class and nothing else. You can use the following codebook (with classes, definitions and examples) to help you classify the sentence: ### IMPORTANT CODEBOOK: ### Class: UX ### ### Definition: User’s opinion about the IMapBook interface, or media they wish we would include, user experience, media, relationship with the media. ### ### Example: “I'm finding this program a bit slow and difficult to work in.” “I am not a fan of the sound effect, but would be a fan of some pictures.” ###  ### Class: Social ### ### Definition: Discussion that establishes or maintains a relationship and does NOT relate to the assignments. For example, greetings. ### ### Example: Hello! I’m excited to work with you all. ###  ### Class: Procedure ### ### Definition: Discussion toward accomplishing a task. How should the task be accomplished? Specifically, discussion of how to complete the assignment.  Big Question: How does this work? What does the teacher want us to do with this assignment? ### ### Example: Are we each supposed to submit our own interpretations or compose something together? Did we submit it? Is that why it's blank now?  What time is everyone available to meet and complete the task? ###  ### Class: Deliberation ### ### Definition: Turns related to decision-making about the content…. Or writing or wording.  For example, what should be included in a collaborative submission, how it should be worded.  The internal procedure of the group. Actionable..  This includes discussion about interpersonal functioning of the group.  Big Question: What should we do next? <Based on our current status, how do we move forward?> ### ### Example: What do you think about the questions? How should they be answered?    Nadina: In terms of just answering, I feel like the tiger was behind the door, and later the King puts his daughter to trial… Julie: That’s exactly what I think as well. ###  ### Class: Seminar ### ### Definition: Discussion on the meaning or interpretation of content. My interpretation vs. your interpretation. What does it mean? ### ### Example: Perhaps the content could mean this…  I mean I think it states that the  king does love the daughter at  some point though.
