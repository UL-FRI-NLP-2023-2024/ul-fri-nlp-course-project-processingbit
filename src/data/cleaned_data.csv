pim-12: ""He could know that she knows which door is which and he seems like the type of king to enjoy that punishment""
pim-11: ""Emilie I can see that. ""
pim-11: ""What would you do in her place?""
pim-11: ""Not what do you think she would do, but what would you do if you were in the situation? ""
pim-11: ""I know I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I knew I was the reason the person I loved was killed in such a painful manner""
pim-11: "" It would hurt worse to know his death was my fault than to know that he was happy with someone else. ""
pim-11: ""I think I'd find it easier to move on and live if he was still alive.""
pim-11: ""I mean there are other guys out there after all.""
pim-12: ""I agree.""
pim-12: "" Personally, I would save him. ""
pim-12: ""I'd rather be sad for a little while that the person I loved married someone else, than let them get killed. ""
pim-12: ""I would feel guilty for the rest of my life.""
pim-12: ""And that's true! ""
pim-12: ""There are other guys out there so even if he was the most handsome and all that,""
pim-12: ""I'm sure I would eventually get over him being with someone else""
pim-12: ""I think if I misled him to choose the tiger's door, I would feel like I committed a murder myself""
pim-11: ""I agree with that so much! ""
pim-11: ""But I'm not sure how this princess would think.""
pim-11: ""Do we know how many people are part of this group? ""
pim-11: ""We can try to get in touch with them and decide how we wat to write out the answer""
pim-12: ""I'm not sure! ""
pim-12: ""I tried looking for a ""particpants"" button or something and I couldn't find one.""
pim-11: ""I couldn't either.""
pim-11: ""I sent an email to the coordinator and I hope to hear back from them, but I wouldn't mind setting up a discussion in our class page too""
pim-11: ""You're here for LIS6303 or for another class?""
pim-12: ""I'm also in LIS6303!""
pim-11: ""okay awesome! ""
pim-11: ""I'm going to create a discussion called Book Club 4 and see if we can see if there is anyone else who is part of that group.""
pim-12: ""Good idea!""
pim-12: ""So how do you guys think we should end it?""
pim-11: ""I'm honestly okay with either ending, ""
pim-11: ""but I think we should incorporate the King mentioning that he helped feed his daughter the information on what was behind each door. ""
pim-11: ""That's just my opinion though.""
pim-11: ""Also, I got an email letting us know that Elias Royal is also a part of our group. ""
pim-11: ""I want to wait to see what they think about how the ending should go as well.""
pim-11: ""How do you think it should end, Emilie?""
pim-12: ""Of course, we should all definitely have a chance to contribute.""
pim-12: ""I'm also okay with either ending for Part 1 as well. ""
pim-12: ""My initial thoughts were that the princess knows what's behind each of the doors because the King had told her or she figured it out from overhearing him talk about the punishment.""
pim-12: ""I also got the sense that she would point her lover to the tiger's door, but now the more that I think about it, I think she would send him to the other woman.""
pim-12: ""I liked what you mentioned earlier Kyra""
pim-12: ""about how she may have felt guilty.""
pim-12: ""As for Part 2, I have a theory. ""
pim-12: ""I think that when the King discovers his daughter broke the law, he would still make her go through the arena.""
pim-12: ""BUT, he'd tell her which door leads to a man and which leads to the tiger, thinking that she will obviously choose to marry and live.""
pim-12: ""HOWEVER, she is so distraught about losing the love of her life that she actually chooses the tiger's door on purpose.""
pim-12: ""This could either cause the King to become even more barbaric or to stop these trials all together""
pim-12: ""But that's just what I was thinking.""
pim-12: "" I'm definitely okay with another approach that we can all agree on""
pim-11: ""Oooo I like that idea of how he might send her to the arena and then tell her which is behind each door. ""
pim-11: ""This gives her a chance at potential happiness or, if she is feeling miserable and depressed, may want to go through with the tiger!""
pim-11: ""That's certainly an interesting way to look at the potential of that kind of ending.""
pim-11: ""And I almost think if we can't decide we might just flip a coin ""
pim-11: ""lol ""
pim-11: ""(I've been playing dnd too much and it has influenced my writing)""
pim-11: ""Or we could take turns writing out a paragraph and jump one it from the last person's response.""
pim-12: ""Flipping a coin may not be the worst idea, honestly! ""
pim-12: ""I like the idea of writing a paragraph or a few sentences and then bouncing off from there. ""
pim-12: ""That's fun""
pim-11: ""Glad you like that idea ""
pim-11: "":D""
pim-11: ""I think it would be fun too!""
pim-11: ""Oooo I have another idea! What if the princess sends the man to the tiger and right out tells her father she did it and wants a trial. Then because he loves her he begs her to choose the door with the young man he picks for her, but she chooses the tiger.""
pim-12: ""That's a creative idea!""
pim-12: "" I like it""

pim-12: ""I agree.""
pim-12: "" Personally, I would save him. ""
pim-12: ""I'd rather be sad for a little while that the person I loved married someone else, than let them get killed. ""
pim-12: ""I would feel guilty for the rest of my life.""
pim-12: ""And that's true! ""
pim-12: ""There are other guys out there so even if he was the most handsome and all that,""

pim-11: ""okay awesome! ""
pim-11: ""I'm going to create a discussion called Book Club 4 and see if we can see if there is anyone else who is part of that group.""
pim-12: ""Good idea!""
pim-12: ""So how do you guys think we should end it?""
pim-11: ""I'm honestly okay with either ending, ""
pim-11: ""but I think we should incorporate the King mentioning that he helped feed his daughter the information on what was behind each door. ""
pim-11: ""That's just my opinion though.""
pim-11: ""Also, I got an email letting us know that Elias Royal is also a part of our group. ""
pim-11: ""I want to wait to see what they think about how the ending should go as well.""
pim-11: ""How do you think it should end, Emilie?""
pim-12: ""Of course, we should all definitely have a chance to contribute.""
pim-12: ""I'm also okay with either ending for Part 1 as well. ""
pim-12: ""My initial thoughts were that the princess knows what's behind each of the doors because the King had told her or she figured it out from overhearing him talk about the punishment.""
pim-12: ""I also got the sense that she would point her lover to the tiger's door, but now the more that I think about it, I think she would send him to the other woman.""
pim-12: ""I liked what you mentioned earlier Kyra""
pim-12: ""about how she may have felt guilty.""
pim-12: ""As for Part 2, I have a theory. ""
pim-12: ""I think that when the King discovers his daughter broke the law, he would still make her go through the arena.""
pim-12: ""BUT, he'd tell her which door leads to a man and which leads to the tiger, thinking that she will obviously choose to marry and live.""
pim-12: ""HOWEVER, she is so distraught about losing the love of her life that she actually chooses the tiger's door on purpose.""
pim-12: ""This could either cause the King to become even more barbaric or to stop these trials all together""
pim-12: ""But that's just what I was thinking.""
pim-12: "" I'm definitely okay with another approach that we can all agree on""
pim-11: ""Oooo I like that idea of how he might send her to the arena and then tell her which is behind each door. ""
pim-11: ""This gives her a chance at potential happiness or, if she is feeling miserable and depressed, may want to go through with the tiger!""
pim-11: ""That's certainly an interesting way to look at the potential of that kind of ending.""
pim-11: ""And I almost think if we can't decide we might just flip a coin ""
pim-11: ""lol ""
pim-11: ""(I've been playing dnd too much and it has influenced my writing)""
pim-11: ""Or we could take turns writing out a paragraph and jump one it from the last person's response.""
pim-12: ""Flipping a coin may not be the worst idea, honestly! ""
pim-12: ""I like the idea of writing a paragraph or a few sentences and then bouncing off from there. ""
pim-12: ""That's fun""
pim-11: ""Glad you like that idea ""
pim-11: "":D""
pim-11: ""I think it would be fun too!""
pim-11: ""Oooo I have another idea! What if the princess sends the man to the tiger and right out tells her father she did it and wants a trial. Then because he loves her he begs her to choose the door with the young man he picks for her, but she chooses the tiger.""
pim-12: ""That's a creative idea!""

Bye!""","Diane Gonzalez: ""I think the tiger is behind the door, as it would create a plot twist when its not the predictable lady. The king may show mercy towards his daughter, as she is royalty. Instead, she might have to go on a quest of some kind to prove her worth to inherit the thrown one day.""
Deborah Evans: ""I agree with you, Diane Gonzalez. I am convinced that the princess lead the gentleman to the door hiding the tiger. It would make a brilliant plot twist, but with the information we know about the character of the King, that can be found within the princess as well. In my mind she believes if she can't have the man, she sure does not want another woman to have him, especially someone she despises.""
Deborah Evans: ""As for the second part, I'm not sure if the King would carry out the same punishment for his daughter as he would the commoners. However, he would definitely think of another way to punish her that would consist of a clever, yet barbaric twist for her to prove her loyalty and worth.""
Cheryl Diaz: ""Hi Diane Gonzalez and Deborah Evans. I'm sorry to be so late joining the conversation. If I ponder too long, I'll never come to a conclusion, so I'm going to write my first thoughts. I share your  he's barbaric, and he's fine doling out punishment to his own daughter, as his punishment of her lover has in effect punished her as well. take that the princess will direct the gentleman to the tiger - she's lost him either way and her jealousy and barbarism are too great. On the other hand, the text describes her and the gentleman as having one soul, which I take to mean he would know if she chose the tiger, in which case he'd choose the other door, yet he doesn't. So does that mean she didn't choose the tiger? Or that he'd rather die than be with another woman? For Part 2, I believe the king likely would not show mercy, even to his own daughter, as he has consistently relied on this method of justice""
Cheryl Diaz: ""We can continue to discuss individually, or if you want to try writing collaboratively at the same time, please suggest a time. I'm available any evening this week starting at 6 p.m. I'll keep tabs on here from now on to see if you want to do that. Thanks, Robyn""

Ashley Peterson: ""I believe she tells him to open the door with the tiger. This isn't a question of whether or not she loves him, or even trusts him. It's clearly written that she loves him dearly, and his trustworthiness isn't something to consider so heavily since she will lose him heavily. I think she points him to the tiger because of how much more thought she put into the aftermath of sending him towards the lady. She laments on how horrifying it would be to watch her loved one die at the hands of ferocity, but laments even more at the thought of watching him live a different life with someone other than her. She even gives his death a hopeful spin, that they may meet again in the afterlife or some equivalent, but gives no optimistic spin to him choosing the lady, she even mentions the whole if she can't have him no one can.""""""
Ashley Peterson: ""since she will lose him anyway*""
Denise Harris: ""I agree with you ladies. I also think that she sends him to the tiger. She loves him fiercely, so fiercely that she cannot bear the thought of someone else having him. Jealousy can make people do ugly things and mix that in with her pure barbaric nature, it makes sense that she would choose for him to stop living versus living with someone else. Mourning would be easier than seeing the person you love happy with another, which is clear by the ways she describes her thoughts and turmoil over the situation.""

Linda Long: ""lol no, it just seemed like what happened based on her father, and her own jealous nature""
Patricia Green: ""Yes, she did seem very jealous. The story led me to believe she would rather nobody have him if she could not.""
Michelle Rivera: ""from my thoughts I thought yes, he sets up 2 doors for her and lets the trial decide.""
Linda Long: ""I think so. Even though the story said he loved her so much, I think his barbaric nature would take over his reasoning""

Patricia Green: ""Do we choose which door she opens?""

Michelle Rivera: ""I think it's barbaric nature but also slightly just (in a warped way), because as it mentions he treated women and men equally so would feel obliged to treat his daughter the same""

Sandra Coleman: ""Part 1:  I believe that the Princess indicated for her lover to choose the door with the other lady behind it, because her love for him was strong.  Her relationship with him wasn't only passionate feelings, but truly a deep love, that is why it pained the Princess so much to think of her lover with another woman.  I believe that the young man trusted the Princess, because he knew her very well.  He knew that she would defy her father and find the answer to save him.  That's why he looked to her for help.  They knew each other very well.""
Sandra Coleman: ""Part 2:  I believe that the King made his daughter face her fate in the King's arena.  The King did not consider his daughter's feelings when he made her lover enter the arena.  The King didn't care whether or not his daughter would be traumatized by the event.  By sending his daughter's lover to the arena, he proved that he cared more about his own rules than the happiness and well-being of his family.  The King was more barbaric than civilized and he was very set in his ways.""
Nicole Gonzalez: ""Hello Sandra Coleman, I think it's a good point you made that the King did not consider his daughter's feelings when he made her lover enter the arena.

Kathryn Bell: ""Hi Teresa Stewart, I felt that if he truly knew her, he would know her true character and her barbaric side. The story also noted that she had seen her lover talk to the lady before, and assumed that her jealousy would be known to him prior to his tribunal.""
Emily James: ""I feel that with the personalities traits provided to both the king and princess, she decided that death would be more appropriate than another woman, a rival, living happily with her lover.

Emily James: ""Part 2: With the events led, created, and executed by the king, one would believe he would send his daughter to the arena as she has committed a crime, embarrassed the king, and went against the rules.

He wants to keep in power and with these events, shows his power to rule over life and death.

Katie: ""So it definitely seems like the princess hates the lady behind the door. But if it were me, I couldn't stand to see the man I love being eaten by a tiger.""
Natalie: ""Do you think the lady is more beautiful than the princess?""
Katie: ""I'm not sure. They're probably equally beautiful and just jealous :)""
Natalie: ""ha ha""
Rebecca: ""I think it is entirely possible for the tiger to be behind the door, as the story indicates that she is jealous of the lady and she has a barbaric spirit like her father. However, as Katie said, I don't think she could have watched the tiger eat him if she loved him so much. Also, the end of the story says that she knew he would ask her, just as he knew she would take it upon herself to find out, so I think that she would not be able to lead him to the door with the tiger and live with that, especially if she thought about what she would tell him days before.""

Natalie: ""That's what I thought to or how I interpreted the ending""
Katie: ""If she really loves him, she should want him to be with someone else and alive rather than dead!""
Rebecca: ""Did you guys already read the story? It won't move past the part of four questions for me.""
Katie: ""What about you, Rebecca?""
Natalie: ""It was strange because it seems the daughter is jealous of the lady behind the door. so its an interesting twist""

Katie: ""No worries!""
Rebecca: ""Okay, I agree, I think the lady is behind the door.""
Katie: ""So it definitely seems like the princess hates the lady behind the door. But if it were me, I couldn't stand to see the man I love being eaten by a tiger.""
Natalie: ""Do you think the lady is more beautiful than the princess?""
Katie: ""I'm not sure. They're probably equally beautiful and just jealous :)""
Natalie: ""ha ha""
Rebecca: ""I think it is entirely possible for the tiger to be behind the door, as the story indicates that she is jealous of the lady and she has a barbaric spirit like her father. However, as Katie said, I don't think she could have watched the tiger eat him if she loved him so much. Also, the end of the story says that she knew he would ask her, just as he knew she would take it upon herself to find out, so I think that she would not be able to lead him to the door with the tiger and live with that, especially if she thought about what she would tell him days before.""
Katie: ""Well said, Rebecca""
Natalie: ""Good point you made Rebecca""
Katie: ""Regarding part 2 of the question, what do you think the king does to his daughter?""
Rebecca: ""I think the king would subject her to the same law as everyone else and expect her fate to be decided in the arena.""
Katie: ""Since he's barbaric...maybe he puts her in the ring to face her own doors? :(""
Katie: ""Okay, me too! Sorry there's a bit of a delay on my end.""
Rebecca: ""If he knew his daughter truly loved that man but sent him to the arena because of his barbaric nature, I don't think he would extend any grace to his daughter, even though the story told us that he treasures her.""
Natalie: ""That's what I thought as well. I remember the description of the King being barbaric with his punishments and I think he would put his daughter in front of the doors as well""

Katie: ""Yep.""
Rebecca: ""Do you think that the king would be tempted to do the same thing she did, though, and find out which door was which?""
Natalie: ""I could be wrong but I think the daughter's door opened up to being with her lover?""

Natalie: ""ha ha""
Rebecca: ""I think it is entirely possible for the tiger to be behind the door, as the story indicates that she is jealous of the lady and she has a barbaric spirit like her father. However, as Katie said, I don't think she could have watched the tiger eat him if she loved him so much. Also, the end of the story says that she knew he would ask her, just as he knew she would take it upon herself to find out, so I think that she would not be able to lead him to the door with the tiger and live with that, especially if she thought about what she would tell him days before.""
Katie: ""Well said, Rebecca""
Natalie: ""Good point you made Rebecca""
Katie: ""Regarding part 2 of the question, what do you think the king does to his daughter?""
Rebecca: ""I think the king would subject her to the same law as everyone else and expect her fate to be decided in the arena.""
Katie: ""Since he's barbaric...maybe he puts her in the ring to face her own doors? :(""
Katie: ""Okay, me too! Sorry there's a bit of a delay on my end.""
Rebecca: ""If he knew his daughter truly loved that man but sent him to the arena because of his barbaric nature, I don't think he would extend any grace to his daughter, even though the story told us that he treasures her.""
Natalie: ""That's what I thought as well. I remember the description of the King being barbaric with his punishments and I think he would put his daughter in front of the doors as well""
Katie: ""Yep.""
Rebecca: ""Do you think that the king would be tempted to do the same thing she did, though, and find out which door was which?""
Natalie: ""I could be wrong but I think the daughter's door opened up to being with her lover?""
Natalie: ""There appears to be descriptions of her seeing her lover's face?""
Katie: ""Not really, no. Considering they mention how barbaric he is. I feel like he's a by-the-book sort of guy""
Katie: ""That was in response to Rebecca's question.""
Rebecca: ""Where did you see those descriptions, Natalie?""
Katie: ""Yeah, did they actually put the King's daughter in the arena in the story?""
Rebecca: ""Yeah, I think you're right. But it would be interesting if her lover ended up being behind the door she chose. Although I think the story said that it was people in the king's court that decide who goes behind the door, not the king.""
Rebecca: ""So I'm not sure if the king would've had a hand in putting her lover behind the door.""
Rebecca: ""But it would be interesting if the princess's actions in breaking the law made her father realize just how much she loved the man (if she did tell him of the door with the lady). So maybe he could've used his influence to put her lover behind the door, that way he could still abide by his own law but also extend love to his daughter."""

Natalie: ""I just asked Samantha if this activity is timed or if we need to spend a certain amount of time in the chat, Samantha said we can take as long as we want""
Katie: ""Okay, cool! Should we wait a couple of minutes for Rebecca or get started?""
Natalie: ""Sure let's wait""
Natalie: ""I don't think this e-book times out so we should be ok""
Katie: ""Okay!""
Natalie: ""it says Alexandrea, Matthew and Sara looked at this 18 days ago. How is this possible? I thought the activity just opened up this week?""
Rebecca: ""Hello! I've been on but just noticed the chat feature. We're good to get started :)""
Katie: ""So did I. Do you think they are in another course?""
Katie: ""Oh, hi Rebecca!""
Natalie: ""Okay Hi Rebecca and Katie""
Katie: ""So regarding part 1 of the question, I think the lady is behind the door!""
Natalie: ""That's what I thought to or how I interpreted the ending""
Katie: ""If she really loves him, she should want him to be with someone else and alive rather than dead!""
Rebecca: ""Did you guys already read the story? It won't move past the part of four questions for me.""
Katie: ""What about you, Rebecca?""
Natalie: ""It was strange because it seems the daughter is jealous of the lady behind the door. so its an interesting twist""
Katie: ""Oh, sorry! Yes I read it""
Katie: ""Rebecca, it was a bit glitchy with me at times and I refreshed and logged back in""
Natalie: ""Oh yeah Rebecca, in order to get past page 8, you have to form 5 questions with the tiles on bottom of screen""
Natalie: ""Hint I _____him?""
Natalie: ""then click submit""
Rebecca: ""I tried to read it before 7 but it's stuck on that one part""
Natalie: ""then click on the checkmark button""
Natalie: ""I had to ask my spouse for help""
Natalie: ""head in hands""
Katie: ""Oh, yeah! You make up the questions and then can advance!""
Rebecca: ""Yeah I put questions, I'll refresh and try again""
Natalie: ""Each time you submit, the lady talks back to you and her icon changes.""
Rebecca: ""Hm it's still not working. Sorry guys I'm trying""
Natalie: ""Which browser did you use?""
Natalie: ""It took me 10 tried. Then I got it""
Natalie: ""It doesn't matter the combo of the questions""
Rebecca: ""I'm in google chrome""
Katie: ""Yes, it has to be chrome or firefox""
Rebecca: ""Ok it's finally working. I'll read the next part quickly and then I'll be good to keep going. Sorry guys, thanks for your help""
Katie: ""No worries!""
Rebecca: ""Okay, I agree, I think the lady is behind the door.""
Katie: ""So it definitely seems like the princess hates the lady behind the door. But if it were me, I couldn't stand to see the man I love being eaten by a tiger.""
Natalie: ""Do you think the lady is more beautiful than the princess?""
Katie: ""I'm not sure. They're probably equally beautiful and just jealous :)""
Natalie: ""ha ha""
Rebecca: ""I think it is entirely possible for the tiger to be behind the door, as the story indicates that she is jealous of the lady and she has a barbaric spirit like her father. However, as Katie said, I don't think she could have watched the tiger eat him if she loved him so much. Also, the end of the story says that she knew he would ask her, just as he knew she would take it upon herself to find out, so I think that she would not be able to lead him to the door with the tiger and live with that, especially if she thought about what she would tell him days before.""
Katie: ""Well said, Rebecca""
Natalie: ""Good point you made Rebecca""
Katie: ""Regarding part 2 of the question, what do you think the king does to his daughter?""
Rebecca: ""I think the king would subject her to the same law as everyone else and expect her fate to be decided in the arena.""
Katie: ""Since he's barbaric...maybe he puts her in the ring to face her own doors? :(""
Katie: ""Okay, me too! Sorry there's a bit of a delay on my end.""
Rebecca: ""If he knew his daughter truly loved that man but sent him to the arena because of his barbaric nature, I don't think he would extend any grace to his daughter, even though the story told us that he treasures her.""
Natalie: ""That's what I thought as well. I remember the description of the King being barbaric with his punishments and I think he would put his daughter in front of the doors as well""
Katie: ""Yep.""
Rebecca: ""Do you think that the king would be tempted to do the same thing she did, though, and find out which door was which?""
Natalie: ""I could be wrong but I think the daughter's door opened up to being with her lover?""
Natalie: ""There appears to be descriptions of her seeing her lover's face?""
Katie: ""Not really, no. Considering they mention how barbaric he is. I feel like he's a by-the-book sort of guy""
Katie: ""That was in response to Rebecca's question.""
Rebecca: ""Where did you see those descriptions, Natalie?""
Katie: ""Yeah, did they actually put the King's daughter in the arena in the story?""
Rebecca: ""Yeah, I think you're right. But it would be interesting if her lover ended up being behind the door she chose. Although I think the story said that it was people in the king's court that decide who goes behind the door, not the king.""
Rebecca: ""So I'm not sure if the king would've had a hand in putting her lover behind the door.""
Rebecca: ""But it would be interesting if the princess's actions in breaking the law made her father realize just how much she loved the man (if she did tell him of the door with the lady). So maybe he could've used his influence to put her lover behind the door, that way he could still abide by his own law but also extend love to his daughter.""
Katie: ""I honestly found the writing style in the story kind of confusing?""
Katie: ""Anyone else?""
Rebecca: ""Me too I had to reread the first couple pages several times before I understood what was going on.""
Katie: ""Same.""
Katie: ""Natalie, are you still there?"""

Natalie: ""Do you think the lady is more beautiful than the princess?""
Katie: ""I'm not sure. They're probably equally beautiful and just jealous :)""
Natalie: ""ha ha""
Rebecca: ""I think it is entirely possible for the tiger to be behind the door, as the story indicates that she is jealous of the lady and she has a barbaric spirit like her father. However, as Katie said, I don't think she could have watched the tiger eat him if she loved him so much. Also, the end of the story says that she knew he would ask her, just as he knew she would take it upon herself to find out, so I think that she would not be able to lead him to the door with the tiger and live with that, especially if she thought about what she would tell him days before.""
Katie: ""Well said, Rebecca""
Natalie: ""Good point you made Rebecca""
Katie: ""Regarding part 2 of the question, what do you think the king does to his daughter?""
Rebecca: ""I think the king would subject her to the same law as everyone else and expect her fate to be decided in the arena.""
Katie: ""Since he's barbaric...maybe he puts her in the ring to face her own doors? :(""
Katie: ""Okay, me too! Sorry there's a bit of a delay on my end.""
Rebecca: ""If he knew his daughter truly loved that man but sent him to the arena because of his barbaric nature, I don't think he would extend any grace to his daughter, even though the story told us that he treasures her.""
Natalie: ""That's what I thought as well. I remember the description of the King being barbaric with his punishments and I think he would put his daughter in front of the doors as well""
Katie: ""Yep.""
Rebecca: ""Do you think that the king would be tempted to do the same thing she did, though, and find out which door was which?""
Natalie: ""I could be wrong but I think the daughter's door opened up to being with her lover?""
Natalie: ""There appears to be descriptions of her seeing her lover's face?""
Katie: ""Not really, no. Considering they mention how barbaric he is. I feel like he's a by-the-book sort of guy""
Katie: ""That was in response to Rebecca's question.""
Rebecca: ""Where did you see those descriptions, Natalie?""
Katie: ""Yeah, did they actually put the King's daughter in the arena in the story?""
Rebecca: ""Yeah, I think you're right. But it would be interesting if her lover ended up being behind the door she chose. Although I think the story said that it was people in the king's court that decide who goes behind the door, not the king.""
Rebecca: ""So I'm not sure if the king would've had a hand in putting her lover behind the door.""
Rebecca: ""But it would be interesting if the princess's actions in breaking the law made her father realize just how much she loved the man (if she did tell him of the door with the lady). So maybe he could've used his influence to put her lover behind the door, that way he could still abide by his own law but also extend love to his daughter.""
Katie: ""I honestly found the writing style in the story kind of confusing?""
Katie: ""Anyone else?""
Rebecca: ""Me too I had to reread the first couple pages several times before I understood what was going on.""
Katie: ""Same.""
Katie: ""Natalie, are you still there?""
Rebecca: ""I guess that was all we had to do? I don't know if there's anything else to discuss""
Katie: ""Okay, cool""
Katie: ""Thanks, everyone!""
Katie: ""Enjoy the wedding!"""

Katie: ""Not really, no. Considering they mention how barbaric he is. I feel like he's a by-the-book sort of guy""
Katie: ""That was in response to Rebecca's question.""
Rebecca: ""Where did you see those descriptions, Natalie?""
Katie: ""Yeah, did they actually put the King's daughter in the arena in the story?""
Rebecca: ""Yeah, I think you're right. But it would be interesting if her lover ended up being behind the door she chose. Although I think the story said that it was people in the king's court that decide who goes behind the door, not the king.""
Rebecca: ""So I'm not sure if the king would've had a hand in putting her lover behind the door.""
Rebecca: ""But it would be interesting if the princess's actions in breaking the law made her father realize just how much she loved the man (if she did tell him of the door with the lady). So maybe he could've used his influence to put her lover behind the door, that way he could still abide by his own law but also extend love to his daughter.""
Katie: ""I honestly found the writing style in the story kind of confusing?""
Katie: ""Anyone else?""
Rebecca: ""Me too I had to reread the first couple pages several times before I understood what was going on.""
Katie: ""Same.""
Katie: ""Natalie, are you still there?""
Rebecca: ""I guess that was all we had to do? I don't know if there's anything else to discuss""

Natalie: ""Sure let's wait""

Katie: ""Oh, hi Rebecca!""
Natalie: ""Okay Hi Rebecca and Katie""
Katie: ""So regarding part 1 of the question, I think the lady is behind the door!""
Natalie: ""That's what I thought to or how I interpreted the ending""
Katie: ""If she really loves him, she should want him to be with someone else and alive rather than dead!""
Rebecca: ""Did you guys already read the story? It won't move past the part of four questions for me.""
Katie: ""What about you, Rebecca?""
Natalie: ""It was strange because it seems the daughter is jealous of the lady behind the door. so its an interesting twist""
Katie: ""Oh, sorry! Yes I read it""
Katie: ""Rebecca, it was a bit glitchy with me at times and I refreshed and logged back in""

Rebecca: ""Ok it's finally working. I'll read the next part quickly and then I'll be good to keep going. Sorry guys, thanks for your help""
Katie: ""No worries!""
Rebecca: ""Okay, I agree, I think the lady is behind the door.""
Katie: ""So it definitely seems like the princess hates the lady behind the door. But if it were me, I couldn't stand to see the man I love being eaten by a tiger.""
Natalie: ""Do you think the lady is more beautiful than the princess?""
Katie: ""I'm not sure. They're probably equally beautiful and just jealous :)""
Natalie: ""ha ha""
Rebecca: ""I think it is entirely possible for the tiger to be behind the door, as the story indicates that she is jealous of the lady and she has a barbaric spirit like her father. However, as Katie said, I don't think she could have watched the tiger eat him if she loved him so much. Also, the end of the story says that she knew he would ask her, just as he knew she would take it upon herself to find out, so I think that she would not be able to lead him to the door with the tiger and live with that, especially if she thought about what she would tell him days before.""
Katie: ""Well said, Rebecca""
Natalie: ""Good point you made Rebecca""
Katie: ""Regarding part 2 of the question, what do you think the king does to his daughter?""
Rebecca: ""I think the king would subject her to the same law as everyone else and expect her fate to be decided in the arena.""
Katie: ""Since he's barbaric...maybe he puts her in the ring to face her own doors? :(""
Katie: ""Okay, me too! Sorry there's a bit of a delay on my end.""
Rebecca: ""If he knew his daughter truly loved that man but sent him to the arena because of his barbaric nature, I don't think he would extend any grace to his daughter, even though the story told us that he treasures her.""
Natalie: ""That's what I thought as well. I remember the description of the King being barbaric with his punishments and I think he would put his daughter in front of the doors as well""
Katie: ""Yep.""
Rebecca: ""Do you think that the king would be tempted to do the same thing she did, though, and find out which door was which?""

Katie: ""Oh, hi Rebecca!""
Natalie: ""Okay Hi Rebecca and Katie""
Katie: ""So regarding part 1 of the question, I think the lady is behind the door!""
Natalie: ""That's what I thought to or how I interpreted the ending""
Katie: ""If she really loves him, she should want him to be with someone else and alive rather than dead!""
Rebecca: ""Did you guys already read the story? It won't move past the part of four questions for me.""
Katie: ""What about you, Rebecca?""
Natalie: ""It was strange because it seems the daughter is jealous of the lady behind the door. so its an interesting twist""
Katie: ""Oh, sorry! Yes I read it""
Katie: ""Rebecca, it was a bit glitchy with me at times and I refreshed and logged back in""

Rebecca: ""Ok it's finally working. I'll read the next part quickly and then I'll be good to keep going. Sorry guys, thanks for your help""
Katie: ""No worries!""
Rebecca: ""Okay, I agree, I think the lady is behind the door.""
Katie: ""So it definitely seems like the princess hates the lady behind the door. But if it were me, I couldn't stand to see the man I love being eaten by a tiger.""
Natalie: ""Do you think the lady is more beautiful than the princess?""
Katie: ""I'm not sure. They're probably equally beautiful and just jealous :)""
Natalie: ""ha ha""
Rebecca: ""I think it is entirely possible for the tiger to be behind the door, as the story indicates that she is jealous of the lady and she has a barbaric spirit like her father. However, as Katie said, I don't think she could have watched the tiger eat him if she loved him so much. Also, the end of the story says that she knew he would ask her, just as he knew she would take it upon herself to find out, so I think that she would not be able to lead him to the door with the tiger and live with that, especially if she thought about what she would tell him days before.""
Katie: ""Well said, Rebecca""
Natalie: ""Good point you made Rebecca""
Katie: ""Regarding part 2 of the question, what do you think the king does to his daughter?""
Rebecca: ""I think the king would subject her to the same law as everyone else and expect her fate to be decided in the arena.""
Katie: ""Since he's barbaric...maybe he puts her in the ring to face her own doors? :(""
Katie: ""Okay, me too! Sorry there's a bit of a delay on my end.""
Rebecca: ""If he knew his daughter truly loved that man but sent him to the arena because of his barbaric nature, I don't think he would extend any grace to his daughter, even though the story told us that he treasures her.""
Natalie: ""That's what I thought as well. I remember the description of the King being barbaric with his punishments and I think he would put his daughter in front of the doors as well""
Katie: ""Yep.""
Rebecca: ""Do you think that the king would be tempted to do the same thing she did, though, and find out which door was which?""
Natalie: ""I could be wrong but I think the daughter's door opened up to being with her lover?""
Natalie: ""There appears to be descriptions of her seeing her lover's face?""
Katie: ""Not really, no. Considering they mention how barbaric he is. I feel like he's a by-the-book sort of guy""
Katie: ""That was in response to Rebecca's question.""
Rebecca: ""Where did you see those descriptions, Natalie?""
Katie: ""Yeah, did they actually put the King's daughter in the arena in the story?""
Rebecca: ""Yeah, I think you're right. But it would be interesting if her lover ended up being behind the door she chose. Although I think the story said that it was people in the king's court that decide who goes behind the door, not the king.""
Rebecca: ""So I'm not sure if the king would've had a hand in putting her lover behind the door.""

Natalie: ""ha ha""
Rebecca: ""I think it is entirely possible for the tiger to be behind the door, as the story indicates that she is jealous of the lady and she has a barbaric spirit like her father. However, as Katie said, I don't think she could have watched the tiger eat him if she loved him so much. Also, the end of the story says that she knew he would ask her, just as he knew she would take it upon herself to find out, so I think that she would not be able to lead him to the door with the tiger and live with that, especially if she thought about what she would tell him days before.""
Katie: ""Well said, Rebecca""
Natalie: ""Good point you made Rebecca""
Katie: ""Regarding part 2 of the question, what do you think the king does to his daughter?""

Katie: ""Yep.""
Rebecca: ""Do you think that the king would be tempted to do the same thing she did, though, and find out which door was which?""
Natalie: ""I could be wrong but I think the daughter's door opened up to being with her lover?""
Natalie: ""There appears to be descriptions of her seeing her lover's face?""
Katie: ""Not really, no. Considering they mention how barbaric he is. I feel like he's a by-the-book sort of guy""
Katie: ""That was in response to Rebecca's question.""
Rebecca: ""Where did you see those descriptions, Natalie?""
Katie: ""Yeah, did they actually put the King's daughter in the arena in the story?""

Rebecca: ""Okay, I agree, I think the lady is behind the door.""
Katie: ""So it definitely seems like the princess hates the lady behind the door. But if it were me, I couldn't stand to see the man I love being eaten by a tiger.""
Natalie: ""Do you think the lady is more beautiful than the princess?""
Katie: ""I'm not sure. They're probably equally beautiful and just jealous :)""
Natalie: ""ha ha""
Rebecca: ""I think it is entirely possible for the tiger to be behind the door, as the story indicates that she is jealous of the lady and she has a barbaric spirit like her father. However, as Katie said, I don't think she could have watched the tiger eat him if she loved him so much. Also, the end of the story says that she knew he would ask her, just as he knew she would take it upon herself to find out, so I think that she would not be able to lead him to the door with the tiger and live with that, especially if she thought about what she would tell him days before.""
Katie: ""Well said, Rebecca""
Natalie: ""Good point you made Rebecca""
Katie: ""Regarding part 2 of the question, what do you think the king does to his daughter?""
Rebecca: ""I think the king would subject her to the same law as everyone else and expect her fate to be decided in the arena.""
Katie: ""Since he's barbaric...maybe he puts her in the ring to face her own doors? :(""
Katie: ""Okay, me too! Sorry there's a bit of a delay on my end.""
Rebecca: ""If he knew his daughter truly loved that man but sent him to the arena because of his barbaric nature, I don't think he would extend any grace to his daughter, even though the story told us that he treasures her.""
Natalie: ""That's what I thought as well. I remember the description of the King being barbaric with his punishments and I think he would put his daughter in front of the doors as well""
Katie: ""Yep.""
Rebecca: ""Do you think that the king would be tempted to do the same thing she did, though, and find out which door was which?""
Natalie: ""I could be wrong but I think the daughter's door opened up to being with her lover?""
Natalie: ""There appears to be descriptions of her seeing her lover's face?""
Katie: ""Not really, no. Considering they mention how barbaric he is. I feel like he's a by-the-book sort of guy""
Katie: ""That was in response to Rebecca's question.""
Rebecca: ""Where did you see those descriptions, Natalie?""
Katie: ""Yeah, did they actually put the King's daughter in the arena in the story?""
Rebecca: ""Yeah, I think you're right. But it would be interesting if her lover ended up being behind the door she chose. Although I think the story said that it was people in the king's court that decide who goes behind the door, not the king.""
Rebecca: ""So I'm not sure if the king would've had a hand in putting her lover behind the door.""
Rebecca: ""But it would be interesting if the princess's actions in breaking the law made her father realize just how much she loved the man (if she did tell him of the door with the lady). So maybe he could've used his influence to put her lover behind the door, that way he could still abide by his own law but also extend love to his daughter.""
Katie: ""I honestly found the writing style in the story kind of confusing?""
Katie: ""Anyone else?""
Rebecca: ""Me too I had to reread the first couple pages several times before I understood what was going on.""
Katie: ""Same.""
Katie: ""Natalie, are you still there?""

412.0 (Bryce): ""hello!""
428.0 (Andrew): ""'But it remains important to consider how our food choices impact the climate since food production at large, from farming to distribution, makes up over a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.' would this work""
412.0 (Bryce): ""What's our prompt?""
423.0 (Lindsay): ""'What are the compelling arguments for and/or against eating locally sourced food? Why are those arguments compelling?""
412.0 (Bryce): ""So we are trying to figure out why are the stories compelling us to eat locally?""
412.0 (Bryce): ""So we should find quotes that compel or attract people to eat locally.""
414.0 (Maxwell): ""yes. Then we will include them into a paragraph and explain why these quotes/ideas are compelling""
412.0 (Bryce): ""I can give you guys some quotes and you can try to sypher them into paragraphs if you guys would like that.""
428.0 (Andrew): ""so are we for or against local eating""
414.0 (Maxwell): ""we have to give both sides. We dont pick a side""
414.0 (Maxwell): ""well i think so""
412.0 (Bryce): ""'As the FAO's Dada explained, 'We are trying to get production to shift toward efficiency because we know there is so much food wastage, from the time you sow the food to the time you have it on your plate,' including long-distance transportation, storage and processing.

412.0 (Bryce): ""What?""
412.0 (Bryce): ""'Producing and consuming livestock wouldn't reduce food's climate impact'""
412.0 (Bryce): ""Their is no page 10""
412.0 (Bryce): ""'The way we produce food is failing us,' said Zitouni Ould Dada, deputy director of the UN FAO's climate and environment division, in an interview after the event. 'The whole system of land use has to change. We need to produce food with the land we have.'""
412.0 (Bryce): ""This is for anti local food""
414.0 (Maxwell): ""ooo thats a good one""
386.0 (Mr. Vona): ""This is a great start. Make sure you are focusing on what the prompt is asking as you start to put these pieces together.""
428.0 (Andrew): ""sorry i meant page 7 not 10""

412.0 (Bryce): ""'But a new report from Our World In Data found that 'eating local' is actually 'one of the most misguided pieces of advice,' as Our World in Data researcher Hannah Ritchie put it.
