I believe that the Princess displayed qualities of progressivism from the very beginning; she choose who to love on her own accord which proves that she believes in free will and the importance of making your own decisions in life. With that being said, this is this very reason that I believe she sends her lover to the door of the tiger; she obviously believes in free will, but she still has semi-barbaric tendencies which may cause her to put her own free will above everyone else's.\u001b[00m\n"
