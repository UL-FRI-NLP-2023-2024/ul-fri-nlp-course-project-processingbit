Qualitative discourse analysis is an important way social scientists research human interaction. Large language
models (LLMs) offer potential for tasks like qualitative discourse analysis, which demand a high level of inter-rater
reliability among human “coders” (i.e., qualitative research categorizers). This is an exceedingly labor-intensive
task, requiring human coders to fully understand the discussion context, consider each participant’s perspective,
and comprehend the sentence’s associations with the previous discussion, as well as shared general knowledge.
In this task, you create a model to categorize postings in online discussions, such as in a corpus — an online
discussion about the story, “The Lady, or the Tiger?”. We provide a coded dataset with a high inter-rater reliability
and a codebook including definitions of each category with examples. Your task is building and training a highly
reliable language model for this coding task that generalizes to other online discussions.
